<!-- the following code above was for the text and answer boxes in the feedback form.
the element tag 'input type' is important as it creates the small area for the user
to type in the information needed to fill out the form.

     <!--This part of the feedback form is the same as the other text input. The only difference
     with this is that it the text box for this requires a long answer. To allow this, a small
     style element was included here which was the height of the text box.
